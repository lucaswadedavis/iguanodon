# Iguanodon

Iguanodon is a boilerplate Flask app, mostly a reminder to myself for later when I've forgotten how exactly to serve static assets and make a route.

## How To:

Just clone the repo and make sure you have Flask installed ('pip install Flask' is probably the simplest way) then from a terminal in the iguanodon directory run 'python server.py' and you're off to the races! (you can navigate to the app from a browser at localhost:5000)
